[Edit Mode](https://wiki.highfidelity.com/wiki/Edit_Mode) allows you to create various different entity types. One of the options is a **Particle entity**. Particle entities are used to create effects made up of many small parts, such as fire, smoke, or falling leaves.

*Note: To create entities you must be in a virtual world where you have permission to add entities.*

## Create a Particle Entity

With [Edit Mode](https://wiki.highfidelity.com/wiki/Edit_Mode) enabled, you can create a Particle entity by selecting the **Particle** icon.

A particle entity first appears as a fountain of small white particles.

## Properties

An entity's appearance (size, position etc.) and behavior (animation, collision, interaction, etc.) are defined by the entity's properties.

Particle entities have the [properties common to all entities](https://wiki.highfidelity.com/wiki/EntityItemProperties#Common_Properties) as well as additional [Particle specific properties](https://wiki.highfidelity.com/wiki/EntityItemProperties#ParticleEffect).

You can view and edit the common properties in [Edit Mode](https://wiki.highfidelity.com/wiki/Edit_Mode) by selecting the entity and then selecting the **Entity Properties** tab in the *Edit* panel. To edit the particle specific properties, select the **Particle Explorer** tab in the *Edit* panel.

*Note: The \**Color** property appears on both the **Entity Properties** tab and the **Particle Explorer** tab. This is the same property but note that when you change the value in one tab the value isn’t updated in the other. However, if you change the value in one tab, then go to the **Entity List** tab and select another entity then go back and select the Particle entity, you’ll see that the value is updated in both tabs.*
