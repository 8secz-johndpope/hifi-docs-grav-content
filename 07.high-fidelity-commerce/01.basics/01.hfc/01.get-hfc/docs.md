*Learn how you can get your initial grant of HFC to start shopping in High Fidelity.*

## Introduction

High Fidelity Commerce is in closed Beta. This means when you first set up your [Wallet](../../../marketplace/wallet-setup), you will not have any HFC available to start shopping. 

You can request to be a part of the closed Beta and receive an initial grant of free HFC by emailing us at info@highfidelity.com and sending us:

* Your username
* The email address associated with your High Fidelity account.
