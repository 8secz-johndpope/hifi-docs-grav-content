You can contribute to our docs as well! 

If you feel we've missed out on something, or you wish to expand more on a particular topic, you can add your contributions to the docs too. 

##How to Contribute

To make changes:

* Go to the page you'd like to change. 
* Click on "edit this page" on the top right hand corner. 
* You'll be directed to our Github repository where you can make the required changes. 

##File Format & Type

Our docs run on a flat-file CMS called Grav. All the pages you see have been written in Markdown. You can check out our Markdown Guide in this section to learn more. 

Since we're using Grav and it's documentation theme, we need to ensure that every page follows the page type requirements specified by Grav. 

This means, when you create a new markdown file, you'll need to ensure the following:
* Create a new folder for your page. It should start with a number to indicate where it falls in the navigation. The folder name should be in small letters with no spaces and only hyphens between words. For example, if you want to write about creating an avatar attachment, you'll need to find the appropriate chapter folder first. After you open the chapter folder, see what topics are present and where your page will fall. If the chapter Avatar folder has two topics, 01.create-avatar and 02.avatar-bookmarks, you can add your page after avatar bookmarks and name it 03.create-an-avatar-attachment. 

* Each folder should contain only one markdown file. When you create and save your markdown file, make sure you name it "docs". 

* Your markdown file should have a YAML statement before your content. Your YAML code should look like this:

  <code> title: Your Page Title </code>
