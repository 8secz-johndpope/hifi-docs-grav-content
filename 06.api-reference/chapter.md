# API Reference

**Under Construction**: We're currently working on creating an API Reference where you can access functions and events easily. 



Check out our latest API Reference here. We're doing our best to keep this reference up-to-date with each release. In these initial stages, we see numerous changes in High Fidelity over a short period of time. Due to this, certain APIs may not be documented or up-to-date. If you don't find what you're looking for or feel there is some information missing, please contact us at [docs@highfidelity.io](mailto:docs@highfidelity.io).
