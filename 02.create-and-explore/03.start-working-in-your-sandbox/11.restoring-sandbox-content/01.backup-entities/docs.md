*Learn how to only backup the entities in your sandbox.*

###Backup Only Entities

To backup only the entities in your sandbox:

1. In a web browser on your sandbox machine, visit http://localhost:40100/. This opens up the domain-server settings. 
2. Click ‘Content’ in the main menu. 
3. The links listed in this window show you where your entities are located on your machine. 
4. Save a copy of the models.json.gz file (and any backups you'd like to keep) to a safe location on your computer or externally

The backup files are configured in your domain settings, and will not immediately be replaced. Older copies of your backups will be overwritten based on your domain server backup settings.
