Before you start exploring High Fidelity, you need to get familiar with your HMD and its controls. 

We provide this in a tutorial that is launched when you first run High Fidelity. This tutorial will guide you through moving your arms, grabbing and using objects and moving around (teleporting) in-world. 

Once you complete this tutorial, you can teleport to **Welcome** and start exploring Interface!
