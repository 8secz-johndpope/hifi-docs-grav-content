## Introduction

You can use the menu items in High Fidelity to load an avatar you created, to get a virtual pet from the Marketplace, and travel to different domains for events and to meet your friends. 

###Audio

###Menu
This is the main menu which contains items such as File, Edit, Tools, Avatar and Settings. You can also turn on the Advanced and Developer menus through this menu. 

###Bubble
High Fidelity respects your privacy. We've created the Bubble to ensure that no avatar can see if you they walk into your personal space while in VR. When you turn on the bubble, a bluish trasparent sphere will be visible when an avatar touches your bubble.

###People
People shows you the users who are online and available in the domain you are presently in. You can make new friends or even find someone you're looking for. We have a new feature called the handshake. When you shake hands with someone in High Fidelity, they automatically become your connection. You can find all your connections and if they're online by going to People > Connections. 

###GoTo
GoTo helps you navigate to different domains and your home domain (or your sandbox). When you click on GoTo, you can search for your domain by typing its name or you can look for places you want to visit. If you click on a snapshot of a domain, GoTo will take you the point where the snapshot was taken.
