[Create Mode](http://localhost/create-and-explore/entities/create-mode) allows you to create various different entity types. Box and Sphere entities are two of the options available.

*Note: To create entities you must be in a virtual world where you have permission to add entities.*

## Create a Box or Sphere Entity

With [Create Mode](http://localhost/create-and-explore/entities/create-mode) enabled, you can create a Box entity by selecting the **Cube** icon and a **Sphere** entity by selecting the Sphere icon.

A Box entity is cube shaped and a Sphere entity is sphere shaped. When Box and Sphere entities are first added, they are red by default.

## Properties

An entity's appearance (color, size, position etc.) and behavior (animation, collision, interaction, etc.) are defined by the entity's properties.

Box and Sphere entities have the [properties common to all entities](http://jsref.docs.highfidelity.com/v1.0/docs/entity-properties#section-common-properties). Box entities have one additional [Box specific property](http://jsref.docs.highfidelity.com/v1.0/docs/entity-properties#boxentity) and Sphere entities have one additional [Sphere specific property](http://jsref.docs.highfidelity.com/v1.0/docs/entity-properties#sphereentity).

You can view and edit these properties in [Create Mode](http://localhost/create-and-explore/entities/create-mode) by selecting the entity and then selecting the **Entity Properties** tab in the *Edit* panel.

## Example: Create a Yellow Cube

For example to create a cube and then edit its color property so that the cube is yellow, complete the following steps:

1. In Edit Mode, click the Cube icon to create a Box entity. A red cube should appear directly in front of you.

   ​

2. Select the cube and then select the **Entity Properties** tab in the *Edit* panel.

3. Scroll down the Entity Properties until you see the Entity color option.

   ​

   The current values are Red: 255, Green: 0, and Blue: 255.

4. To change the cube's color to yellow, change the Green value to 255.

   ​

   If you use the carats to change the value, as you increase the value you should see the cube change from red, to orange, to yellow. If you enter in 255, you will see the cube change to yellow as soon as you press enter.
