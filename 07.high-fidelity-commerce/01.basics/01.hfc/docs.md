*Learn more about High Fidelity Coins (HFC)*

## Introduction

High Fidelity Coins is a cryptocurrency that is empowered by blockchain technology.

We are currently giving out the currency for anyone interested in participating in the closed beta for High Fidelity Commerce. These coins are to be used as currency for any commerce transactions in the Marketplace. Since we are using blockchain technology, all transactions with HFCs will be publically recorded and stored. 

Your Wallet is accessed by logging into your High Fidelity account. In addition, you will select a Security Picture, which serves as an extra layer of security for your Wallet. When you see your Security Picture, you know that your actions and data are securely making use of your account.

HFC is not intended for speculators to hold and should be used in transactions in High Fidelity. HFC is intended to be a stable currency and used to support a healthy and vibrant virtual economy for digital goods and assets.
