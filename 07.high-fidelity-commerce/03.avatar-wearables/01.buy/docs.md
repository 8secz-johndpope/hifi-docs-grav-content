- Avatar Island is a domain containing many stores which carry all kinds of wearables. You can create wearables to sell at the Avatar Island too! ![](avatar-island.jpg)

- We're going to walk you through purchasing a skirt, pair of headphones and some green hair for your avatar. We're going to visit the store named "A & J". ![](a-n-j.PNG)![](a-n-j-inside.PNG)

- Let's first try on the headphones. If you're using an HMD with controllers, you can just pick up the headphones you want and place them on your head. You'll hear a musical chime indicating that the wearable has been placed on the joint. If you're in Desktop mode, just click on the headphones of your choice. It will be placed around your avatar's head. You can adjust your wearables in VR mode by using moving it with your controllers. In Desktop mode, you can pull up your tablet, and go to the **Wear** app to adjust any wearable.

  > > > > > If you don't want to purchase any of the wearables, you can simply walk out of the store without checking out. All wearables you are wearing will disappear when you leave. You can also take them off in VR mode or delete them using the **Wear** app in Desktop mode. If you want to see how your avatar looks with various wearables on, you can look at yourself in one of the many mirrors in the store. 

- Once you are done selecting the wearables you want to buy, head over to one of the checkout kiosks. When you are close to a kiosk, you will see the items you picked in the shelf marked "Pick Items". Your tablet will also open your wallet and ask for your passphrase. 

- You can choose the items you want to purchase and pick them up and place them on the scanner marked "Scan Items". 

- Purchase the item.
