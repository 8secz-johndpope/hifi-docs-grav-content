The **Interface** is our client. This means that when you launch Interface, you can explore VR worlds created in High Fidelity and interact with other users. You can visit your friend's VR world, meet people, attend events and even go for a class on avatar creation. It's an immersive and interactive experience with realistic visuals and audio.

Once you complete the tutorial, you can teleport to the **Welcome** domain.

In Welcome, you can talk to other users and the greeters, and explore the myriad possibilities of High Fidelity.

To get started, you need to pull up your tablet. Check out all you need to know about the tablet and other tools in High Fidelity in the next page.
