When you first start [Interface](../../../../get-started/how-it-works#interface), it runs a number of [default scripts](https://wiki.highfidelity.com/wiki/Default_scripts) designed to improve the experience. One of these scripts, `notifications.js`, [generates notifications](https://wiki.highfidelity.com/wiki/Manage_notifications#Notifications_Generated) that let you know about system changes. It also adds a new menu item, **Tools > Notifications**, that allows you to [play a sound](https://wiki.highfidelity.com/wiki/Manage_notifications#Play_Notification_Sounds) when a specific type of notification is received.

## Notifications Generated

`notifications.js` generates notifications that let you know about system changes. By default, you will receive a notification when:

- The microphone is muted or unmuted
- The Interface screenshot tool is used
- The Interface window is resized
- The level of detail that can be rendered falls below a certain threshold
- A network connection has been refused

Notifications appear as text on a semi-transparent panel.

Notification panels will disappear after a few seconds, but they can also be immediately dismissed by clicking the X in the upper right hand corner of the notification.

## Play Notification Sounds

You can specify that a sound be played when a notification has been generated by selecting **Tools > Notifications > Play Notification Sounds**. If notification sounds are enabled, a check will appear next to **Play Notification Sounds**.

Using the **Tools > Notifications** menu, you can also select which types of notification will generate a sound when received. A check next to the notification type indicates that a sound will be played.
