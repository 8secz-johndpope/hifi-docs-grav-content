When you first use High Fidelity, your experience is determined by whether or not you're wearing a Head Mounted Display (HMD). 

If you are wearing an HMD, you will see your Sandbox first. Your Sandbox is your own space where you can create content, host events and hang out with your friends.

If you're in Desktop Mode, you will enter the domain in Interface where our Welcome Wagon currently is stationed. Our Welcome Wagon is a first-time user experience where you can check out our community rules, meet other users and chat with our greeters.
