The **Interface** is our client. This means that when you launch Interface, you can explore VR worlds created in High Fidelity and interact with other users. You can visit your friend's VR world, meet people, attend events and even go for a class on avatar creation. It's an immersive and interactive experience with realistic visuals and audio.

If you're in Desktop mode, you'll start your High Fidelity journey in a domain that contains the Welcome Wagon. The Welcome Wagon is a great starting point where you can:

* Meet other users. 
* Talk to our greeters to learn more about High Fidelity. 
* Check out our community rules. 
* Try out our avatar attachments!
