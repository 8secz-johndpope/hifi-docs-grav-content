**Groups and lists** are the basic units of social organization in High Fidelity. Groups and lists are structured like MMORPG guilds and white/blacklists, respectively. Users can buy a group or list on highfidelity.com, invite others to it, and edit others' permissions within the group or list.

High Fidelity is working on adding group and list integration to the Domain Server, letting domain operators exert fine-grained control over who is allowed on their domain, and what they can do.

## Differences Between Groups and Lists

There are a few differences between groups and lists which are outlined here:

- Group members will join by invitation.
  - Group members will have the option to reject an invitation, and not be a part of the group.
  - Group members may also leave the group at any time.
  - A group is visible to anyone who is invited, so you will know if you are a member or not.
- List members can be added without notice.
  - List members will be added to the group by administrators of the group. They may not reject their addition to the group.
  - A list is only visible to those members who have permissions within it.

These differences are meant to allow a list to be used as a white/blacklist, without alerting those within the list to their membership.

## Starting a Group or List

Both start the same - they can be purchased [here](https://www.highfidelity.com/user/groups/new) with your metaverse account. Once purchased, you'll need to select how to use it - as a group or a list. Currently the type selection will be permanent. If you buy and make a group, you will not be able to convert it to a list later (and vice versa).

Once you've made your selection, you can start adding members. On the group (or list) screen, you will be able to see if a member has accepted your invitation, and you will be able to assign ranks to members to give them different permissions within the groups. These permissions (and the abilities they grant) are:

- **Edit Group**: edit group/list description and image.
- **Edit Rank**: add/remove/reorder ranks, and edit their permissions. Users will only be able to edit those ranks below their own.
- **List Ranks**: view all ranks.
- **List Permissions**: view all ranks and their permissions.
- **Edit Member**: add/remove users to the group/list, and edit their ranks. Users will only be able to assign ranks below their own.
- **List Members**: view all members.
- **Query Member**: ask if a specific user is a member of a group, and his/her rank (this will be necessary for the Domain Server to utilize groups, when that feature is released).

Certain permissions depend on others, and will be automatically added. If you give a user a Query Member rank, List Ranks will be added as well.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you create a group or list?

Visit [https://www.highfidelity.com/user/groups/new](https://www.highfidelity.com/user/groups/new) to purchase a group or list.

### What is the difference between a group and a list?

Although they are both purchased in the same way, a group is more appropriate for a "guild" or "club". Every member will know that they are a part of the group. A list is more appropriate for a white/blacklist. Only those members with permissions will know that they are in the list, so blacklisted members can be left in the dark.

### Can I share a group or list?

You can share a group or list by adding the user you'd like to share with as a member. If they want to use it for their domain security, you'll need to give them Query Member permission, at the very least.

### How do ranks work?

Each member of the group or list must be assigned a rank. This dictates what that user is able to see or edit within the group, as follows:

- **Edit Group**: edit group/list description and image.
- **Edit Rank**: add/remove/reorder ranks, and edit their permissions. Users will only be able to edit those ranks below their own.
- **List Ranks**: view all ranks.
- **List Permissions**: view all ranks and their permissions.
- **Edit Member**: add/remove users to the group/list, and edit their ranks. Users will only be able to assign ranks below their own.
- **List Members**: view all members.
- **Query Member**: ask if a specific user is a member of a group, and his/her rank (this will be necessary for the Domain Server to utilize groups, when that feature is released).

### How do I add my groups or lists to my domain?

When released, you will be able to add (or remove) permissions to a group/list, by rank, on the Domain Settings page, reachable by right-clicking the High Fidelity icon in your system tray.

### How can I tell if someone has accepted my group invitation?

If it is for a group, you will need List Members permission, and an hourglass will appear in the Accepted column of the group's page until they have accepted, at which point it will become a check mark.

If it is for a list, members are added without an invitation.

### Can I delete a group/list if I don't want it anymore? Can I get my money back?

Right now, groups and lists cannot be deleted once purchased. If you need help, contact us at [support@highfidelity.com](mailto:support@highfidelity.com).

### Can I give a group/list to someone else?

Right now, groups and lists cannot be transferred. If you need help, contact us at [support@highfidelity.com](mailto:support@highfidelity.com).

### What happens to my group/list if it expires and I don't renew?

Once your group/list expires, the name will be open for anyone to renew. You may renew your group/list up to thirty days before its expiration.
