##High Fidelity Commerce Basics

Here is some basic information that will help you understand how commerce works in High Fidelity:

* Blockchain Technology: Our new currency, High Fidelity Coins (HFC), will be a public blockchain with a consensus group of multiple parties. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions. We are using blockchain technology to track and record transactions made using HFC. All information on a blockchain exists as a shared database, which means the records are public and verifiable. It is not centralized. We are also using the blockchain to store information about digital asset ownership in High Fidelity. This enables us to protect intellectual property by embedding certification in items in the blockchain. HFC will be convertible to local currencies or other cryptocurrencies at popular exchanges. 
* Certification: All items being bought or sold will have the PoP (Proof of Provenance) license certificate. This certification is a .json string that contains static properties that are sealed and cannot be altered. This means that once an item is certified, it's certification cannot be modified.
