<h5 class="#sec-pg-body-1">What is Virtual Reality?</h5>
<p>Virtual Reality or VR is an interactive computer generated simulation of 3D content. This means you can, using the right equipment, interact and explore 3D content in a realistic world environment. Recent innovations in VR allow users to interact with these objects, creating a whole new way to create and share.</p>

<h5 class="#sec-pg-body-2">What do you need to use VR?</h5>
<p>You can be a part of VR using a Headset or Head Mounted Display (HMD) and hand controllers. The HMD allows users to see into the VR world in three dimensions. Itâ€™s responsive to your movement, creating a real sense of immersion in the virtual environment. Hand controllers allow a user to grab and manipulate objects in the virtual environment.</p>
